Welcome to my blog! My name is Mateusz Wenus and I am software developer from Poland. Currently I work as subcontractor for [Pretius](http://www.pretius.com/), IT company located in Warsaw. 

Most of the time I design and implement web applications in Java, but I'm always eager to expand my knowledge (there's still so much to learn, even in the Java world). I have started this blog to have a place to write about my findings and to have a better motivation to constantly learn new things. If someone finds my posts useful, it will be additional bonus.

I hope you will enjoy reading my blog.
